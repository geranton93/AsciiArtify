# Proof of Concept (PoC) - AsciiArtify GitOps Deployment with ArgoCD

## Overview

The pilot version of AsciiArtify is currently in development, and the team has agreed to use a GitOps approach to manage the infrastructure. For deploying the GitOps system, the team has chosen ArgoCD.

At this stage, Proof of Concept (PoC), we will verify the technical feasibility of implementing the product's concept. To do this, we will use a minimal set of features to demonstrate the system's functionality and perform its basic functions.
